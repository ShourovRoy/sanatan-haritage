  <h1>The Essence of Bhagavad Gita</h1>
  <h2>1. Dharma (Duty and Righteousness)</h2>
  <p>
    The Gita emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's duty (dharma)
    according to their position in life and society. Arjuna, a warrior, is
    reminded of his duty to fight for justice and righteousness.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Karma Yoga (Path of Selfless Action)</h2>
  <p>
    One of the core teachings is to perform one's duties without attachment to
    the results. This path of selfless action, or Karma Yoga, is about acting
    rightly and dutifully, without concern for personal gain or loss.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Jnana Yoga (Path of Knowledge)</h2>
  <p>
    The Gita also discusses the path of knowledge (Jnana Yoga), which involves
    understanding the true nature of reality, the self, and the universe. This
    path focuses on wisdom and insight into the nature of existence.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Bhakti Yoga (Path of Devotion)</h2>
  <p>
    Another significant path described is Bhakti Yoga, the path of devotion to
    God. This involves surrendering oneself to a higher power, cultivating love
    and devotion towards God, and seeing the divine presence in all aspects of
    life.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Detachment and Renunciation</h2>
  <p>
    The Gita teaches the importance of detachment from the material world and
    its pleasures. True renunciation is about giving up the ego and desires,
    rather than merely abandoning physical possessions.
  </p>

  <h2>6. The Nature of the Self (Atman)</h2>
  <p>
    It explains the eternal nature of the soul (atman) which is beyond birth and
    death. The physical body is temporary, but the soul is eternal and
    unchanging.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Yoga and Meditation</h2>
  <p>
    The text outlines the practice of yoga and meditation as means to achieve
    spiritual growth and self-realization. These practices help in controlling
    the mind and senses and attaining inner peace.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Divine Manifestations</h2>
  <p>
    Krishna reveals his divine form and explains his incarnations, emphasizing
    that God descends to earth in various forms to restore dharma and protect
    the righteous.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bhagavad Gita serves as a spiritual guide, offering profound
    philosophical insights and practical guidance for living a life of purpose,
    righteousness, and spiritual fulfillment.
